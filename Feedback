Laika app is a very easy and useful small toolkit for requesting smart contract. I not only complete the steps that  bounties required, but I also try my smart contract.

I just study web3 things, but this tool is easy for me. so it is very kind to beginner. 

I will continue to use laika in smart contract development.s
